# Minecraft written in Swift

Somewhat inspired by [minecraft-weekend](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend) 
and was originally an attempt at porting the project to Swift, however I decided to start from scratch.

Currently There's a triangle rendered using OpenGL and some setup for a usable, generic renderer implementation.
